# ISSTracker

This is the ISS Tracker program that will locate the location of the ISS and the location will change every 10 minutes.

How To Run:
1. Download the project with all the files and run it.
2. Install geocoder by pip install geocoder and import geocoder library into your code to get your location based on IP Address.
3. User enter date and time and it will print/display the date and time 10 minutes before and after the time.
4. Then run the program (python main.py) and it will display a pop out browser of the people on ISS and map with the location of the ISS and the location will change every 10 minutes.

**Extension A & B:**
I've implemented extension A & B for the program. I'm using an API to get the location - latitude and longitude of the ISS and additional information of the people on ISS.
I'm also displaying the map where the location of the ISS on the map.
